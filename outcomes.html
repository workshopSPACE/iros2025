        In this workshop, we aim to focus on human-robot interaction controlled mainly via 
        LLMs, with an explicit focus on physical interaction between human and robot in 
        cooperative tasks. In particular, we target three exciting and challenging goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building together HRI benchmark and standardization of the metrics and techniques in these studies</li>
        <li>Contributing to the categorization of the different emerging approaches and techniques</li>
        <li>Fostering the creation of a community of researchers around the topics of the workshop and promoting research collaboration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The workshop organizers aim to prepare a potential Special Issue, using the 
        insights and discussions generated during the sessions. Participants will be 
        encouraged to actively contribute to the special issue to ensure diverse 
        perspectives and comprehensive coverage of the topics discussed, thereby 
        increasing the impact of the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, the workshop program will alternate interactive activities with panel sessions and keynote presentations. 
        The invited speakers have strong expertise in Human-Robot Interaction with various robotic platforms, with backgrounds ranging 
        from machine learning to cognitive science. Their goal is to share and integrate knowledge to plan future directions and encourage 
        collaboration through oral presentations, round-table discussions, poster sessions, and demonstrations.
