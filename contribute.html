      <h2>Call for Posters</h2>
      <p>In this workshop, we aim to delve deeper into this scientific trend by bridging  various disciplines, integrating both academic and corporate research, and 
        connecting different regions. We will explore state-of-the-art robotic frameworks, particularly humanoids, with a strong emphasis on benchmarking and AI for 
        human modeling. For this reason, the program includes a poster and demo session in the middle of the workshop, just before a short coffee break. 
        We believe that positioning the session at the heart of the event, combined with the brief break, will encourage you to quickly grab a drink and continue engaging in discussions around 
        posters and demos. <br>
        Each presentation will start with a 2-3 minutes pitch talk, providing an overview of the presented work. In particular, we strongly encourage video demos during this session to foster more 
        concrete and interactive discussions among participants. <br>
      <br>
