        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In the last year, the use of <strong>Large Language Models</strong> (<strong>LLMs</strong>) has rapidly spread in our society, 
            opening challenges and opportunities in diverse fields from information retrieval to text 
            classification, as well as robotic applications. In this last field, the majority of research 
            studies focused on the exploration of the LLM potential in dialogue or chatting scenarios, 
            with an increasing interest for <strong>planning</strong> and <strong>controlling</strong> robots in a more <strong>reactive</strong> and
            <strong>natural way</strong>, through language. This capability leads to amazing opportunities to create 
            novel robotics applications, especially in those involving <strong>collaboration</strong> with humans
            through <strong>physical interaction</strong>. The emergence of collaborative robots is becoming 
            increasingly important as robots are shaping various aspects of human life. For example, in
            assistive environments, these solutions are meant to cater to the personal needs of the user, 
            offering a <strong>personalized</strong> environment for communication, coping with the large behavioural 
            differences or physical abilities between individuals. Investigating the “<strong>reasoning</strong>” potential 
            to plan and control joint-action scenarios where the <strong>humanoid robot cooperates</strong> with the 
            human represents a compelling interest for their potential future contribution in assistive 
            contexts, not only in terms of AI architecture and accuracy, but also regarding safety, 
            reliability feedback and social perception from the final users.

        <h2>Expected outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            In this workshop, we aim to focus on human-robot interaction controlled mainly via 
            LLMs, with an explicit focus on physical interaction between human and robot in 
            cooperative tasks. In particular, we target three exciting and challenging goals:
            • building together HRI benchmark and standardization of the metrics and techniques in these studies,
            • contributing to the categorization of the different emerging approaches and techniques,
            • foster the creation of a community of researchers around the topics of the workshop and promote research collaboration.
            The workshop organizers aim to prepare a potential Special Issue, using the 
            insights and discussions generated during the sessions. Participants will be 
            encouraged to actively contribute to the special issue to ensure diverse 
            perspectives and comprehensive coverage of the topics discussed, thereby 
            increasing the impact of the results. For this reason, the workshop program 
            will alternate interactive activities with panel sessions and keynote 
            presentations. The invited speakers have strong expertise in Human-Robot 
            Interaction with various robotic platforms, with background from machine 
            learning to cognitive science perspective, to share and integrate their 
            knowledge to plan the future directions, and encourage researchers, through 
            a mix of oral presentations, round-table discussions, poster sessions and 
            demonstrations. In addition, we plan to invite participants to propose demosin video format- of collaborative HRI scenarios, 
            and organize such presentation in a dedicated session during the workshop.
