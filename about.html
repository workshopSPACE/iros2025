        In the last year, the use of <strong>Large Language Models</strong> (<strong>LLMs</strong>) has rapidly spread in our society, 
        opening challenges and opportunities in diverse fields from information retrieval to text 
        classification, as well as robotic applications. In this last field, the majority of research 
        studies focused on the exploration of the LLM potential in dialogue or chatting scenarios, 
        with an increasing interest for <strong>planning</strong> and <strong>controlling</strong> robots in a more <strong>reactive</strong> and
        <strong>natural way</strong>, through language. This capability leads to amazing opportunities to create 
        novel robotics applications, especially in those involving <strong>collaboration</strong> with humans
        through <strong>physical interaction</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emergence of collaborative robots is becoming increasingly important as robots are shaping various aspects of human life. 
        For example, in assistive environments, these solutions are meant to cater to the personal needs of the user, 
        offering a <strong>personalized</strong> environment for communication, coping with the large behavioural 
        differences or physical abilities between individuals. Investigating the “<strong>reasoning</strong>” potential 
        to plan and control joint-action scenarios where the <strong>humanoid robot cooperates</strong> with the 
        human represents a compelling interest for their potential future contribution in assistive 
        contexts, not only in terms of AI architecture and accuracy, but also regarding safety, 
        reliability feedback and social perception from the final users.
